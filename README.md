The application is a console program for processing text using the Caesar cipher.

Installation:
No installation required, the program broadcasts work to the console.

Requirements:
It is necessary to use an alphabet identical to that of the text, the Russian alphabet is used by default, which means that the encryption/decryption text must also be Russian.

Functionality:
1. Text encryption - reads a file with text, the path to which must be specified, encrypts the text using the key that must be specified and writes the result to a file, the path to which must be specified.
2. Text decryption - reads a file with encrypted text, the path to which must be specified, decrypts the text using the key that must be specified and writes the result to a file, the path to which must be specified.
3. Brute force decryption - reads a file with encrypted text, the path to which must be specified, goes through all possible shifts in the alphabet and writes the result to a file, the path to which must be specified.
